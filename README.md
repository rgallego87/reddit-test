# InnoCells React Native Coding Challenge

For this challenge you're going to create a basic React Native Reddit app, this
will give us an idea about your coding skills.
Reddit is a news website wherein registered users can submit posts or links to
content that other users can vote and comment, the total number of votes
determine the position of the post inside the website, each of these posts are
grouped into categories known as “subreddits”.

## Requirements:
 1. Use a FlatList to display a scrollable list of the last posts in the r/pics
 subreddit
 2. Each post must show the following data: thumbnail image (if present),
 title, author, total number of votes (score), number of comments and
 date of creation
 3. Once the user taps on a post, open a WebView with the contents of the
 post URL
 4. Ability to refresh the posts list

## Extra included

- ES6
- Date of creation in a relative format (e.g. “1 day ago”)

## Notes

- Do not focus too much on the design
